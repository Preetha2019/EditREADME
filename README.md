# PART I- Honing Your C Skills
## CHAPTER I- The C Philosophy
The first C languuage was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972 and ran on a DEC PDP-11.
The __ANSI__ standard for C, which replaced the standard writted by _Kernighan and Ritchie_ in 1978.
Here __ANSI__ stands for American National Standard Institute(ANSI). It produces standards that help keep each of the compilers working in the same manner.
#### Power of C
Most of C's power comes from these attributes:
* C can address and manipulate memory by direct address
* C has a powerful library of functions
#### Conditions:
* If the compiler does extend the ANSI compiler minimum limits and you use the extensions, you can be sure that when your program is compiled with another compiler, it will either not compile correctly or not execute correctly.
* Don't use all of the ANSI keywords are in lowercase as identifiers in program.Generally the compilers 'complines' when incorrectly use any reserved keyword.
### A Programming Style
1. Each tab is indented four characters.
2. Lines should be a maximum of 80 characters if at all possible.
Comments can use either the __ANSI__ standard /* comment */ or the newer //single line comment.gjhsgjad
